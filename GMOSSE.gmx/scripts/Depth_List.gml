/*
Recorded list from hand of different depth values.
Ideally this should be reduced to as minimum amount of different depth values
as possible in order to easily facilitate migration to GMS2, which will auto
generate compatibility layers set to these depths depending on objects present.
More depth values = more layers, and we want less layers.

Player weapons currently use inconsistent values, enemies too but less so.
