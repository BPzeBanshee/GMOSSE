/* 
Some notes:

GMFMODSimple-related commands like loop points
will not be supported if GMFMODSimple is removed
and the substitute sound engine does not support it.
Path, title, game and artist tags are irrespective
of the sound engine itself so these are compatible.

Also note that this uses EXACTLY the same format
as Xeno Fighters R's custom music format, so modders
can change the music as required without having to
modify much. The functionality for this is just 
as easy to remove if you don't want it though.
