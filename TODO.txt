***************Overall:
- finish obj_ctrl_game
- eradicate obj_player_clear with event check in obj_player
- 2P support
- fix parent/child relationship with enemy parents
	- should be:
		- obj_en (event_user(15) and flash/z effects)
		\_ obj_en_air (is dragged with screen)
		\_ obj_en_ground (is left as is)
			\_ obj_wall (inherit from obj_en_ground)

***************Stage 2:
- make third pattern for ANTICHRIST: dual spiral attack
- fix stupid placing of enemies near end (red variant of obj_3Den3?)
-- I'm thinking Radio Zonde style: change enemy wave spawn
depending on which brick gap to go through
- obj_en6 (bounce off walls) is a buggy piece of shit
- check that stage 2 actually ends at position y=0
- check that obj_midboss1 is stopping at the same place
- fix rm_boss2 so it plays warning/music at the same time as rm_stage2

***************Stage 3:
- fucking get started on it
-- start orbiting Earth, travel into atmosphere, into storm with battleships
