## FAQ ##

### What is GMOSSE? ###
The word *GMOSSE* is an acronym. It stands for *Game Maker Open-Source Shmup Engine*.
It serves as a swiss army knife of resources culminating in a perfectly playable shmup with all the technical features the STG community come to expect from such a game, and is also my personal playground for testing new features.

### What style of STG are you going for here ###
How a STG should be made is a balance between the interests of ***you*** as the developer, and the ***audience*** you're targeting with your project. I originally wrote this project in 2011 with features that were in vogue at the time and with quite a few influences, but in hindsight the game could be a lot more entertaining. It's an engine demo first, good game second, subject to change.

### What version of GameMaker does this target ###
Ideally the latest one (as of writing GameMaker v2024.2). There is a legacy branch for those interested that contains the last commit of the project when it was still operating on Game Maker Studio 1.4.9999.
