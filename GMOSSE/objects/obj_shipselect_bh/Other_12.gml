The Twin Shot weapon was the 
standard weapon you began with 
in NCS' 1992 Sega Megadrive game
''Advanced Busterhawk: Gleylancer''.
It is overall well-balanced and easy
to use for all difficulties.";

case 2: 
msg = @"Attack = 1 [0.55]

The Laser weapon at first does not
appear to be very powerful, but
on the contrary it deals high
damage when properly used due to
its penetrative nature.";

case 3: 
msg = @"Attack = 1 [0.25]

The Bound shot is primarly useful
for shooting around walls.
However, since there aren't always
walls in some stages of GMOSSE, this
weapon could be rendered useless.";

The Spread Bomb has an extremely
high attack power, but has the 
worst firerate of all weapons 
in G.M.O.S.S.E.
Useful for taking down singular 
targets, or smaller enemies.";

The Saber laser sword is quite 
powerful and useful for taking 
out enemies with multiple parts, 
however it has a short distance.
Recommended only for veterans.";

The Burner flamethrower is
useful depending on the 
situation at hand. Requires
concentration of flame and
relatively short distance
to operate efficiently.";

The Wide Shot has great gaps
in its shot angle angles and 
leaves proper coverage to be 
desired by the inexperienced
operator. Use at your own risk.";
